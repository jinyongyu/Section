#### with Elizabeth Spiers


#### 3Ls Framework
- Length - Try to communicate with 20 percent of the original length
- Language - Make your writing resonate with your audience
- Lede - Place your question, main takeaway, or call to action upfront

#### Length: Best Practices
-   Over-contextualizing, recontextualizing, or over-explaining - Only providing the context your audience needs (particularly with leadership)
-   Using “filler” words like in order to, as a matter of fact, like, very*, basically, etc. - Cutting filler words, or using sparingly for emphasis
-   A large block of text - Smaller sections of text, separated by bullets or headers
-   Text-heavy slides - Charts and visual slides

#### Language: Best Practices and Examples 
- Passive language - active language
- Clipped language - an empathetic, warm, respectful tone
- Talking down to the reader -assuming your reader is at least as smart as you are
- Heavy jargon - Only using jargon if it’s familiar to your audience and more efficient than plain language 

#### Lede: Best Practices
- Burying the lede - Frontloading your question, main takeaway, or call to action
- All points treated equally to persuade - Emphasizing your core argument to persuade
- Prioritizing - based on what you care about
- Creating bias - Recognizing your bias and calling it out when necessary
