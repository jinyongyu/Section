# The Productivity & Performance Sprint
### Stop wasting time. Start making progress.
### with Sahar Yousef & Lucas Miller
#### Welcome

Welcome to your course! You're about to jump into an engaging experience where you'll learn an actionable framework and apply it in a short project. You can expect to spend approximately 1-2 hours watching videos, and another 1-2 hours on your workbook and project.

#### What you’ll learn

• Understand how the biology of the human brain and body are at complete odds with the way we work in our modern work culture
• Apply a neuroscience-based approach to boost your focus and energy
• Implement a productivity system that minimizes distraction, reduces procrastination, and optimizes meaningful work and peak performance
• Create effective habits to sustain your productivity over the long-term

#### How you’ll learn
This course includes three elements:

• Lesson and case study videos
• Optional Workbook
• Project

For each module, watch the video and complete the optional, associated worksheet in the Workbook & Project Materials ([Microsoft Word](https://media.sectionschool.com/courses/the-productivity-and-performance-sprint/Section_Productivity_Sprint_Sample_Solution.docx)). You should make a personal copy of this document and keep it open in another window.

Once you watch all of the videos, check out the project instructions in the Workbook & Project Materials ([Microsoft Word](https://media.sectionschool.com/courses/the-productivity-and-performance-sprint/Section_Productivity_Sprint_Sample_Solution.docx)). Create and submit your project via the survey to earn a LinkedIn badge. You do not need to submit your workbook.
