#### Amplify
- Allow the **space for all voices** to be heard
  - Invite people to contribute, never force anyone to
- Give individuals **credit for thier work**
  - Allow them to share their own work
  - Still give them credit if they aren't present
  - Intervene when others take credit for thier work
- Actively facilitate
  - Guide discussions, coach tough converstaions, sometimes be the referee
  - Don't allow individuals to talk over another

**He-peating** when a women suggests an idea and is ignored. Then a guy later repeates the same idea and is applauded, praised, and celebrated

Creating spaces for all voices to be hear
- Give others an option to participate in a different way
- Go out of your way to give someone else credit
- Take control of at least one meeting as an active facilitator (during or after)


#### Advocate

Actively helping others understand a person’s impact in the org.
