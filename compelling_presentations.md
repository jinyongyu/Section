Let's get started!

### Lesson 1 - It's all about storytelling
- The ability to communicate is a required skill  to present ideas in a way that solicits buy in and influences people
- Good stories make for successful communications
- Stories are more compelling

**Limbic System
- Emotions
- Behavior

**Neocortex
- Language
- Rationality

We need to appeal to Limbic System. We want to think we are solely rational individuals but we are not. Tell stories that drive us to be emotionally invested and drives action.

"Start with the soul, end with the sale"

You aren't presenting, your storytelling

Storytellers Craft Narratives
Storytellers Grab & Keep Attention
Storytellers Need Practice

### Lesson 2 - Storytellers craft narratives
#### What does every story have?
- Beginning - Introduction (then build up/tension)
- Middle - Something happens (then impact)
- End - Resolution
It happens over a timeline

#### Four Considerations
To grab and keep your audiences' attention
- Design
- Communications
- Credence
- Energy

### Lesson 3 - Design
**We must optimize design** when telling stories<br>
Design informs now we percieve<br>
If they're reading, they're not listening<br>
People are there to hear you deliver, not read

### Lesson 4 : Communication
Platform: 
- Apple Keynote *easy design
- Windows Powerpoint *ubiquitous
- Google Slides *great for collaboration

**We must optimize how we communicate**

#### Horizontal and Vertical communication (communication payload)
Need to beable to follow narrative by headlines only

#### Variation goes a long way
Novelty is powerful, gets audience 

**We should vary:
- Our volume
- Our tempo
- Our vocal inflections and pitch

**We should vary:
- The communication paylost
- The slide visuals
- The slide speed

### Lesson 5 - Credence
Belief in or acceptance as something as true

**Conditions for credence
- Impartiality - apparent absence of bias
- Expertise - acknowledged mastery of subject matter
- Status - position within social heirarchy

**We must optimize credence** when we are delivering information

**Quotes** are powerful <br>
**Borrow the voice of others who provide greated credence**

**Use of evidence**<br>
Use Data, can't argue numbers

#### Ensure Clarity:
- Connects to the point
- Limits superfluous information
- Can be understood quickly
#### Establish Credibility:
- Sources are reliable
- You can speak in detail
#### Ensure Relevance:
- Data should be recent
- Data should be specific to audience
- Data should be specific to the cultural moment

### Lesson 6 - Energy
**We must optimize our energy**

It's more than just the words you say, its the delivery of things

It's a bit of a performance

Emote through whole body when storytelling, deliver with energy

### Lesson 7 - You've got to practice
Talk<br>
Move<br>
Sound<br>

Need to get used to yourself

Must practice

All about mindset

Its all about perspective
