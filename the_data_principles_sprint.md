# The Data Principles Sprint

### Power more strategic decisions

#### with Tom Davenport
#### Welcome

Welcome to your course! You're about to jump into an engaging experience where you'll learn an actionable framework and apply it in a short project. You can expect to spend approximately 1-2 hours watching videos, and another 1-2 hours on your workbook and project.


#### What you’ll learn

• Identify business opportunities suited for analytics & the data to fuel them
• Incorporate your expertise into the design of a statistical model
• Interpret data and structure decisions to make recommendations with confidence
• Articulate the capabilities separating today’s analytical leaders from the pack

#### How you’ll learn
This course includes three elements:

• Lesson and case study videos
• Optional Workbook
• Project


For each module, watch the video and complete the optional, associated worksheet in the Workbook & Project Materials ([Microsoft Word](https://media.sectionschool.com/courses/the-data-principles-sprint/Section_Data_&_Analytics_Workbook_&_Project_Materials.docx)). You should make a personal copy of this document and keep it open in another window.

Once you watch all of the videos, check out the project instructions in the Workbook & Project Materials ([Microsoft Word](https://media.sectionschool.com/courses/the-data-principles-sprint/Section_Data_&_Analytics_Workbook_&_Project_Materials.docx)). Create and submit your project via the survey to earn a LinkedIn badge. You do not need to submit your workbook.
