Let’s get started!
### Module 1 - 
### The Power and Process of Analytics
Analytics: a systematic attempt to use data and quatitative analysis to tell us something about the world, either to explain the past better of often to predict the future

- Descriptive - all about the past ex: financial reports
- Predictive - use data from the past to predict the future ex: salesforce sales leads
- Prescriptive - tells someone what to do ex: google maps
- 
Step 1: Input raw data - Quality of data determines quality of analytics

Step 2: Running a Model - traditional analytics or machine learning
- Traditonal analytics best for descriptive
- Machine Learning best for predictive/presciptive

Step 3: Quality Assurance - trial and error process
- Traditional Analytics - check output of model to see if it explains data
- Machine Leaning - data fed then evaluated and improved by software - Human in the loop: When a person monitors the output of machine learning

Step 4: Deployment - Putting the analytical model into production
#### Key Takeaways
- Master the foundations of traditional analytics before involving machine learning
- Analytics is not just for quants - firms need translators to provide business context
- Data-informed decisions are a prerequisite in today's market - companies need to leverage data to survive
#### Case Study: Stitch Fix
Analytical assembly line
- Input Raw Data: gets data from customers on each item with Style Profile survey(*Style Shuffle*). They swipe left/right on what they like. Theyre move valuable data
- Running a Model: Machine learning model provides recommendations using Style Profile survey as well as all reviews and surveys (4.1 million active clients) and  reiews of products in the past and then "stylist" make final decisions from recommendations
- Quality Assurance: human feedback helps quality assurance
- Deployment: used daily
#### Key Takeaways
- Treat analytics as a competitive advantage
- Use analytics to strengthen your relationship with customers
- Make the people behind the process a priority
### Framing the Problem
Without data decisions can be swayed by convincing but misleading anecdotes and opinions<br>
To ensure a data-driven approach is worht the effort, you need to consider how you frame the problem or opportunity you want to investigate<br>
- U - **untested
  - dont want to waste time on problem already tested/understood
  - find something not yet solved
  - can save time/energy
- D - **defined
  - sharp focus clearly indicating what where why
- A - **acute
  - important to orcanization
  - worthy of time and attention
  - major painpoints
- T - **testable
  - *"can i test this with data i already have or can obtain?"
- A - **actionable
  - if insights cant be acted upon, analytics can be wasted effor
  - can it be put in real life use/context
- I - **impactful
  - move needle on at least 1 critical metric
  - sustainable impact that will continue to stay impactful over time

The more of the criteria it can satisfy, the more likely the problem is suited for analytics
#### Key Takeaways
- Analytics is an iterative process
- Evaluate a problem on whether it's acute, impactful, and untested before assessing other categories
- Resist rushing into analysis - spend time to fully understand your problem
- Involve others when framing the problem
#### Case Study: LexisNexis
#### Key Takeaways
- Make your problem defined and testable by framing it around your core competencies
- Focus on untested, acute, and impactul problems to capture market share
- When it comes to actionability, consider the range of use-cases and applications
### Module 2 - 
#### Exploring and evaluating Data
Data is the raw material transformed into insights. 

Data is a set of observations about states of the world. Can take variety of different forms: numbers, satisfaction level, images, recordings of customer service conversations,  etc.

A firm's success with analytics is largely tied to the quality of the data it collects.

- Quality 1: Size, smaller dataset should considered when dealing with traditional analytics. machine learning uses a lot of data. Big data(google, ibm, salesforce).<br>
  - Big Data: large volume and more complex data
- Quality 2: Reliability, (was data collected well?, were there bad typists?, do we let customers describe thier own problem?)
- Quality 3: Unique, if everyone used the same peice of data, chances are, it has little strategic value
- Quality 4: Accessibility

#### Key Takeaways
- Audit your current data collection methods for quality
  - **Qualities of Data**
    - Size
    - Reliability
    - Uniqueness
    - Accessibility
- Identify unique measures of performance
- Data is a vital resource for your firm - treat it with care
#### Case Study: Domino's Pizza
2008 - company struggling
data driven transformation named "the pizza turnaround"
re-envisioned themselves as ecommerce brand
- size, collects massive quantity of data, 17 terabytes of info
- reliable, captured and stndardized data
- unique, enriches private data w/ public data, loyalty program trades pizza for data, data science team classifies image to calssify dominoes or competitor
- accessible, integrated system to be able to be used by multiple teams 
#### Key Takeaways
- Evaluate and collect data across your entire customer journey
- Democratize interpretation of, and action on, data
- Leverage software suppliers to capture and organize your data
#### Model Design
-Guess what factors have the greates influence on the problem
-Creating a hypothesis for what aspects of your data are really important predictors of the outcome that you want to explain.
-Understanding of your industry, customer, and business model are vital in indentifying the various factors shaping a problem and how they interact.
-Translating technical needs of analytical project with the business needs to work well and be easily deployed
#### Analytics Blueprint
- Problem
- Hypothesis
- Variables
  - Independant
  - Dependent
- Data Points
  -  Binary
  -  Categorical
  -  Ordinal
  -  Numerical
#### Key Takeaways
- Hypotheses are educated guessed - keep an open mind and solicit input from key stakeholders
- Whereas machine learning can process many variables, traditional analytics runs better with fewer variables
- Evaluate data complexity when designing a model - when in doubt, keep it simple
#### Case Study: FICO
FICO - Fair Isaac Corporation

Used in 90% of lending decisions

FICO analytics blueprint:
- Problem - Objectively assessing a loans risk
- Hypothesis - the best indicator o f a consumers credit worthiness is thier history of borrowing and repaying loans
- Dependent Variable - the likelihood of a borrower making full/timely loan paymen
- Independent Variable - Payment history and amount owed
#### Key Takeaways
- Frequent, high-stakes decisions call for strong confidence in analytics
- Incorporate various types of data to add contect to an analysis
- Assign different weights to independent variables and data
### Module 3 - 
#### Interpreting results
"Big Data Hubris"

Analytics can be misinterpreted - Confirmation Bias

#### 3 Important Questions:
- Do the results refute or confirm hypothesis?
- How confident are you in the model?
  - Confidence Interval
- Do you understand the causation and correlation?
  - correlation 
  - causation - AB testing
#### Key Takeaways
- Results arent always conclusive - expect to iterate your models
- Question reults that defy the norm
- Don't rush a decision
#### Case Study: moderna
Strong confidence interval and found causal
Ran randomized controlled trial
#### Key Takeaways
- It's okay to start small and graudually increase sample size
- Setting a specific success threshold makes it easier to confirm or refute your hypothesis
- Run experiments multiple times with increasingly larger groups
