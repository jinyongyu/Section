### Power more strategic decisions

#### with Tom Davenport
#### Welcome

Welcome to your course! You're about to jump into an engaging experience where you'll learn an actionable framework and apply it in a short project. You can expect to spend approximately 1-2 hours watching videos, and another 1-2 hours on your workbook and project.


#### What you’ll learn

• Identify business opportunities suited for analytics & the data to fuel them
• Incorporate your expertise into the design of a statistical model
• Interpret data and structure decisions to make recommendations with confidence
• Articulate the capabilities separating today’s analytical leaders from the pack

#### How you’ll learn
This course includes three elements:

• Lesson and case study videos
• Optional Workbook
• Project


For each module, watch the video and complete the optional, associated worksheet in the Workbook & Project Materials ([Microsoft Word](https://media.sectionschool.com/courses/the-data-principles-sprint/Section_Data_&_Analytics_Workbook_&_Project_Materials.docx)). You should make a personal copy of this document and keep it open in another window.

Once you watch all of the videos, check out the project instructions in the Workbook & Project Materials ([Microsoft Word](https://media.sectionschool.com/courses/the-data-principles-sprint/Section_Data_&_Analytics_Workbook_&_Project_Materials.docx)). Create and submit your project via the survey to earn a LinkedIn badge. You do not need to submit your workbook.

Let’s get started!
### Module 1 - 
### The Power and Process of Analytics
Analytics: a systematic attempt to use data and quatitative analysis to tell us something about the world, either to explain the past better of often to predict the future

- Descriptive - all about the past ex: financial reports
- Predictive - use data from the past to predict the future ex: salesforce sales leads
- Prescriptive - tells someone what to do ex: google maps
- 
Step 1: Input raw data - Quality of data determines quality of analytics

Step 2: Running a Model - traditional analytics or machine learning
- Traditonal analytics best for descriptive
- Machine Learning best for predictive/presciptive

Step 3: Quality Assurance - trial and error process
- Traditional Analytics - check output of model to see if it explains data
- Machine Leaning - data fed then evaluated and improved by software - Human in the loop: When a person monitors the output of machine learning

Step 4: Deployment - Putting the analytical model into production
#### Key Takeaways
- Master the foundations of traditional analytics before involving machine learning
- Analytics is not just for quants - firms need translators to provide business context
- Data-informed decisions are a prerequisite in today's market - companies need to leverage data to survive
#### Case Study: Stitch Fix
Analytical assembly line
- Input Raw Data: gets data from customers on each item with Style Profile survey(*Style Shuffle*). They swipe left/right on what they like. Theyre move valuable data
- Running a Model: Machine learning model provides recommendations using Style Profile survey as well as all reviews and surveys (4.1 million active clients) and  reiews of products in the past and then "stylist" make final decisions from recommendations
- Quality Assurance: human feedback helps quality assurance
- Deployment: used daily
#### Key Takeaways
- Treat analytics as a competitive advantage
- Use analytics to strengthen your relationship with customers
- Make the people behind the process a priority
### Framing the Problem
Without data decisions can be swayed by convincing but misleading anecdotes and opinions<br>
To ensure a data-driven approach is worht the effort, you need to consider how you frame the problem or opportunity you want to investigate<br>
- U - **untested
  - dont want to waste time on problem already tested/understood
  - find something not yet solved
  - can save time/energy
- D - **defined
  - sharp focus clearly indicating what where why
- A - **acute
  - important to orcanization
  - worthy of time and attention
  - major painpoints
- T - **testable
  - *"can i test this with data i already have or can obtain?"
- A - **actionable
  - if insights cant be acted upon, analytics can be wasted effor
  - can it be put in real life use/context
- I - **impactful
  - move needle on at least 1 critical metric
  - sustainable impact that will continue to stay impactful over time

The more of the criteria it can satisfy, the more likely the problem is suited for analytics
#### Key Takeaways
- Analytics is an iterative process
- Evaluate a problem on whether it's acute, impactful, and untested before assessing other categories
- Resist rushing into analysis - spend time to fully understand your problem
- Involve others when framing the problem
#### Case Study: LexisNexis
#### Key Takeaways
- Make your problem defined and testable by framing it around your core competencies
- Focus on untested, acute, and impactul problems to capture market share
- When it comes to actionability, consider the range of use-cases and applications
