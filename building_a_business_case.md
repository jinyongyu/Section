### Module 3 - Goal & Hypothesis
- An **executive summary**, outlining the key takeaways from your business case
- The **problem or opportunity** you're addressing
- Your **hypothesis** for how to address the problem or opportunity
- **Alignment** with company strategy/priorities
#### Vetting a problem or opportunity

- **Create** business objectives; ensure they align with team/organization's strategy
- **Share** your idea; revise or come up with alternatives if necessary
- **Prove** the problem or opportunity is worth pursuing
- **Size** the impact
### Module 4 - Proposed Solution
- **Plan** including owners, budget, and the buy-in you've already gotten
- Estimated **timeframe** to implement your solution and **resources** you'll need
- The estimated **impact** of this opportunity
#### Plan Components
- **High-level overview:** What are the key components in your plan? What are the top 3-5 milestones?
- **Budget:** How much funding do you need near-term(1-6 months)? What's the total budget required?
- **Timeline:** How long until you you could start? How long until your plan would be fully rolled out?
- **Owners:** Who's going to make this happen?
- **Buy-in:** Who's already signed off on this plan?
### Module 5 - Success Metrics
- **KPIs** you'll use to measure progress
- A plan on how you'll **track** your KPIs
- Estimated **financial impact** of this opportunity
- **Assumptions** you've made in building your financial case
#### Determining Financial Impact
- Most Critical - Ex: Project Costs, Operating Costs
- Basic Metrics - Ex: Return on Investment(ROI), Breakeven
- Advanced Metrics - Ex: Payback Period, Internal Rate of Return(IRR)
#### Impact and Success Metrics
##### Most critical financial terms in your case
- Project Cost(s) - Project expenditure usually occur at the beginning -- they tend to include development, testing and qualification, training and deployment, and travel costs
- Operating Cost(s) - How much money it will take to maintain whatever you're proposing. These include overhead costs, such as personnel, office space, maintenance and licensing fees, and any other ongoing expenses
##### Financial terms that your audience will likely expect to see
|Metric|What is it?|Why does it matter?|Simple formula|
|---|---|---|---|
|Return on investment (ROI)|A percentage that tells you how profitable an initiative will be|If you can't show your business case is profitable, your audience is *much* less likely to five the green light|Net profit / total costs * 100|
|Breakeven|A number that shows how many sales it will take to get your money back on an investment|Your audience will want a concrete number to understand how many sales are requred before you turn a profit|Fixed costs / contribution margin|
##### Slightly more advance financial terms that your audience will likely expect to see
|Metric|What is it?|Why does it matter?|
|---|---|---|
|Payback Period|A certain type of break even - it shows when your audience recoups their investment|Some audiences need to recoup thier money quickly - you'll need to determine how much this matters for yours|
|Internal Rate of Return(IRR)|A number that estimates how profitable your business case will be|IRR quickly tells your audience how "valuable" your case is. The higher the IRR, the more lucrative the opportunity|
### Module 6 - Risks & Dependencies
- Key **risks** the company/team would take if this solution is implemented
- **Dependencies** for your solution's success
- **Mitigation** plan for risks and dependencies you can influence
- Explain why your propasl is the **most de-risked and viable**
#### Risks vs Dependencies
- Risks - a **hypothetical even that could derail your business case**, or its implementation, if it actually occurs. It would be something out of your control. Will cause you to course correct and pivot based on what you originally planned.
- Dependencies - **events or situations that need to happen before the rest of the plan can be implemented** - i.e. the dependency *must* happen, or else the rest of the plan fails. These can be mitigated with enough planning.
Both risks and dependencies can be **internal or external, micro or macro**

#### Stakeholder Questions to Expect
|Strategy|Operations|Marketing|Product|
|---|---|---|---|
|How does this fit into the company's current roadmap?|If we don't fund this, what is the status quo we're left with?|How do you foresee us introducing the solution?|How does this fit into our existing porfolio?|
|What other possible solutions did you consider|What risks did you consider and how do you recommend mitigation?|What audience insights went into this"(customer survey, brand tracker, concept testing)|Do you foresee this as a compliment to existing solutions or moving into a new category?|
#### Get to an outcome
|What did you hear?|Considerations|Next Steps?|
|---|---|---|
|No, this project isn't a priority|Cases typically get rejected because they're not in synce with strategic goals, projected ROI isn't high enough, or the org simply doesn't have the resources to make it happen|Depending on the reason for rejection, you may be able to build a stronger case later|
|We can't make a decision yet|Stakeholders who agree aobut the business need but don't think you've found the right solution may send you back to the drawing board|Find out what the sticking points are. Does the project take to long? Does it cost too much? Is a strategic element missing? Based on above, adapt|
|We can only approve part of the proposal|2 reaseons why review boards will five the go-ahead on just a portion of the case: process or issues|Move forward on key milestones that can be accomplished with the funding and prove out ROI on phase 1, make adaptations to phase 2 based on learnings|
|Yes, let's move forward|Yes doesnt always mean yes, conflict-averse leaders sometimes approve a project but the never allocate resources for it|Resourcing: Who will elad the project(if not you)? How soon can you have a project plan in place? When can you pull a team together and start on the work? Be ready with answers, you don't want to lose momentum after securing approval|
