### Lesson 1 - Introduction to Data Storytelling

### Lesson 2 - Know-Go-Grow Framework

#### Crafting Your Story
To craft a data-driven story, just remember
- Know: Give context and make them care
- Go: Propose a solution or plan
- Grow: Show the impact

### Lesson 3 - Know: Know-Go-Grow Framework

#### Know: Overview
**What is it?**
- The context that your audience needs to understand - your "know" grounds the audience so that you're all on the same page
- Ideal length: 1-2 pages

**What are the components?**
- Problem/Opportunity
- Data showing the magnitude or urgency of the situation
- Link to company goals or priorities

**What should I keep in mind?**
- Put the problem or opportunity into context
- Get to the point quick
- Don't sugarcoat bad news

#### Types of metrics to check
|Metric Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Absolute|Raw Numbers|We grew revenue from $10M to $20M this year|
|Share|% of a total market|We grew revenue from 5% to 10 % total addressable market share this year|
|Growth|% of a prior period| We grew revenuw 100% year-over-year|

### Lesson 4 - Go: Know-Go-Grow Framework
#### Go: Overview
**What is it?**
- The recommended action to take based on your "know"
- Ideal length: 3-5 pages

**What are the components**
- Proposed next steps/solution
- Data showing why you're convinced this will work
- Details on cost, timeframe, and resources

**What should I keep in mind?**
- Anticipate objections - why would this be a bad idea?
- Include low-risk ways to test your idea
- Vet idea and assumptions with key stakeholders

#### How to Spice up the Go
- *Make it a converstation* - Ask if they agree along the way and open up a dialogue
- *Show your data after* you say your point
- *Shorten for C-Suite* - They don't care about the details as much
- *Ask yourself* - Does my audience need to hea this slide to take action? If not, cut

#### Ways to make your point land
- *In conference room* - Use eye contact and call out people by name
- *On Stage* - Slow dow to emphasize a point
- *On Video* - Play with your vowels

### Lesson 5 - Grow: Know-Go-Grow Framework

#### Grow: Overview
**What is it?**
- The size of the impact of your "Go" recommendation
- Ideal length: 1-2 pages

**What are the components** 
- Estimate of total impact
- Impact broken down over time (e.g. quarterly)
- Risks and dependencies

**What should I keep in mind?**
- Be conservative when estimateing impact
- Be ready to deep dive - build an appendix

#### Slide Percentage of Know/Go/Grow
Aim for around:
- Know: 20%
- Go: 60%
- Grow: 20%

#### Section Recap
- **Use the Know/Go/Grow framework** to outline the components of your data story
  - Your "know" gives context and makes your audience care
  - Your "go" gives a concrete recommendation
  - Your "grow" shows the impact
- At the end of this step, you should have a "text version" of your story - **use the Section4 templates your student participant packet** to map these out in the future
- **Don't focus on perfection** - get your rough draft down!

### Lesson 6 - Charts: Data Visualization

#### Three Steps to Create a Data Story
- Build your narrative
- Choose your charts
- Add your style

#### From Written to Visual
- Write story first, THEN worry about visual/charts

Bar charts
- Your go-to chart
- Easist to read
- Use to call out relative sizes

Line Charts
- Use when you want to show trends oover time
- Don't use when there's little difference, or you have a lot of series to show

Tables
- Use in live dashboards, or when you want to compare multiple items across multiple criteria
- Don't use when you need to control the narrative - tables are read like book pages are very open for interpretation

Overlapping charts
- Use when you have two series that are **causal** of one another
- Use two different y-aces to show scale for both

Share Charts
- Most underused chart type
- Use to hightlight something has growing (or shrinking) importance
- Most likely a better use than a pie chart

Pie Chart
- Almost never the right choice
- Use when you have several items, and one is dominant. Only put color on the category you want to call out
- Colors are important here: make sure you put high contast on the category you're calling out

Scatter Plot (and Optional: Bubble Chart)
- Use when you have several items and need to compare accross two dimensions
- Great to show outliers
- Great for dramatic effect

When possible, Keep it simple
- Choose text when you're focused on **one** number
- 
### Lesson 7 - Style: Data Visualization

**Clear > Pretty**

#### Being "clear" means
- Your visuals emphasize your point
- You keep your overall design simple

**Don't give more info than what's needed**

**Use Heat Maps to direct attention in tables**

#### Avoid Frills (Unless it's strategic)
- No 3D or other distrafting features
- Ask yourself if frill only applies to the thing you want to highlight
  - If it applies to the whole chart, cut it
  - If it applies to something you don't want to highlight, cut it

Keep Chart Designs Simple

Keep Labels and Lines Close

Fancy frills alter perspective

Don't go crazy with colors
- Am I *only* using color to emphasize my point?

Use fonts that make is easy to reaad
- Make the title your bottom line
- **Dont use bold** and *italic at the same time to emphasize, choose one**
- Use normal size fonts (aim for size 12)
- No fancy fonts
- Only use color blocking for section titles
- DON'T USE ALL CAPS
- Use black font for chart labels. For written data work, use black and one color for emphasis (never more than black and 2 colors)
- Don't use wierd angles

Give tables light borders (or none at all)

Use Gridlines sparingly
- Only use when you want to help your audience read charts
- Mostly an eyesore - when in doubt, ditch the grid

Use caution with Dashboards
- Hard to control the story
- Use standard color template

####Section Recap
- **Your style determines the tone of your presentation** - make it playful, serious, artsy, sophisticated, plain, etc. depending on your brand
- **Ask yourself**:
  - Do my visuals help my audience understand my point quicker?
  - Am I using design elements sparingly?
- **Frills** are tempting, but usually distracting

#### Class Recap
- **Draft using the Know/Go/Grow Framework** - this way, you focus on your story befor diving into format
- **Don't just use data viz because it's pretty**. Only use when it helps your audience understand your story better or faster
- Your data viz should be simple, and take less than 5 seconds for someone to understand - **don't overdo the style component**

**Remember, the data is the support, never the main character**
